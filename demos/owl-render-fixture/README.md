# OWL render fixture

This verifier is the first visual gate for the OWL effort. It launches a Chromium host executable on macOS, renders deterministic HTML fixtures, writes PNG artifacts, and checks pixel colors in the captured images.

`OwlLayerHostVerifier` is the current first architecture gate. Swift creates an `OwlBrowserRuntime` from `OwlBrowserCore`, launches Content Shell through Mojo, waits for Chromium to publish a browser-process portal `CAContext` id over Mojo, hosts that id in a native `CALayerHost`, screenshots the Swift-owned host window, and checks the pixels. `OwlBrowserCore` is no longer shaped around `dlopen`: it has a reusable `OwlBrowserRuntime` protocol, an `OwlCBrowserRuntime` implementation that consumes typed C-ABI symbols, and an `OwlDynamicLibraryBrowserRuntime` adapter only for the current verifier build. Swift host requests go through generated transport and pipe binding types from `Mojo/OwlFresh.mojom`: `OwlFreshSession` owns lifetime and client binding, while `OwlFreshProfile`, `OwlFreshWebView`, `OwlFreshInput`, `OwlFreshSurfaceTreeHost`, and `OwlFreshNativeSurfaceHost` own their respective browser surfaces. The verifier no longer uses the old generic `interface + method + JSON` invoke bridge. Generated `MojoPipeBindings` now forward typed pending-handle bind calls for `SetClient` and `Bind*`, then forward typed runtime calls such as resize, key input, surface capture, and popup acceptance. `Scripts/run-layer-host-fixture-verifier-gui.sh` uses a Chromium-owned layer fixture context to prove the Mojo plus native display plumbing. `Scripts/run-layer-host-verifier-gui.sh` uses the real Chromium compositor portal and runs a deterministic canvas fixture plus `https://example.com/` by default. Set `OWL_LAYER_HOST_INPUT_CHECK=1` to also verify real mouse/key input changes web content from `OWL_INPUT_READY` to `OWL_INPUT_CLICKED`, type into a form field, check a checkbox, click submit, verify Command, Option, Control, and Shift modifier key delivery, scroll to a specific numbered content row with a Mojo wheel event, exercise text editing plus selection replacement semantics, and publish native popup surfaces through the Mojo surface tree. Set `OWL_LAYER_HOST_RESIZE_CHECK=1` to verify resize-small and resize-roundtrip by resizing both Chromium web contents and the Swift `CALayerHost` window.

## Current status

The real compositor path is Mojo plus Chromium-owned `CAContext` plus Swift `CALayerHost`. It does not use Unix sockets or remote debugging. The current Swift shape has an `OwlBrowserCore` library for the runtime protocol, C-ABI symbol-table bridge, session events, generated bind graph ownership, and typed browser commands; `OwlLayerHostVerifier` is now a client that owns AppKit hosting, screenshots, fixture orchestration, and artifact reporting. The current Chromium patch adds `fresh-owl-hosted-frame-pump`, a scoped Owl switch that maps hosted surfaces into Chromium's existing renderer, root compositor, and GPU frame-pump settings without passing the broad `--disable-frame-rate-limit` command-line switch.

The current visual gates are intentionally small but behavioral: example.com, deterministic canvas, click, form typing, modifier keys, resize-small, resize-roundtrip, scroll, text-edit selection replacement, widget controls, a browser-default `<select>` with no select CSS, collapsed `<select>` popup publication, right-click context menu publication, and live Google search-box typing. `Scripts/run-layer-host-focused-suites-gui.sh` is the default broad gate: it splits the checks into focused render, input, resize, scroll-text, widgets, and Google batches, writes one artifact directory per suite, and emits a screenshot checklist at `artifacts/layer-host-focused-gui-latest/focused-suites.txt`. The old full all-target run is still useful as a stress test, but it is not the default pass/fail gate because it is flaky after many sequential sessions.

## Next gates

1. Replace the patch-file workflow with an owned Chromium fork or DEPS-pinned patch application step that can be built reproducibly in CI.
2. Promote the focused-suite runner to CI on the AWS Mac so each suite reports its own summary and visual artifact bundle.
3. Add the app-integrated linked symbol provider for `OwlCBrowserRuntime`, then keep the dynamic-library provider as a verifier-only compatibility adapter.
4. Add popup/native widget coverage for color pickers, permission prompts, file pickers, extension bubbles, authentication prompts, and other separate native or `RenderWidgetHostView` surfaces.
5. Add lifecycle coverage for tab attach/detach, hidden/visible transitions, crash/restart recovery, device scale changes, and cross-display moves.
6. Continue moving verifier-only behavior out of `OwlBrowserCore`, keeping screenshots, pixels, and fixture HTML in the verifier while the library owns reusable browser sessions.

`OwlLayerHostSelfTest` is the smallest local rendering gate. Direct mode draws deterministic red, green, blue, and text layers into a normal Swift layer-backed `NSWindow`, proving the window capture environment. Layer-host mode creates a private `CAContext` in Swift, draws the same layers into it, hosts that context in the same Swift `CALayerHost` window path, screenshots the window, and checks the pixels. This isolates whether `CAContext` plus `CALayerHost` plus screenshot capture works before involving Chromium.

On the AWS Mac, visual LayerHost checks must run from the logged-in Aqua bootstrap, not as direct SSH children. SSH-launched windows show up in `CGWindowList`, but WindowServer can return black screenshots. Use `Scripts/run-layer-host-self-test-gui.sh` for the direct plus same-process `CAContext` gates, `Scripts/run-layer-host-fixture-verifier-gui.sh` for the Chromium-owned fixture gate, and `Scripts/run-layer-host-verifier-gui.sh` for the real Chromium compositor gate.

Run on the AWS M1 Ultra host:

For the native Swift display-path gate:

```bash
cd ~/cmux-owl-render-fixture
./Scripts/run-layer-host-self-test-gui.sh
```

Artifacts are written to `artifacts/layer-host-self-test-gui-latest/`.

For the Chromium-owned fixture gate:

```bash
cd ~/cmux-owl-render-fixture
./Scripts/run-layer-host-fixture-verifier-gui.sh
```

Artifacts are written to `artifacts/layer-host-fixture-gui-latest/`.

For the real Chromium compositor gate:

```bash
cd ~/cmux-owl-render-fixture
./Scripts/run-layer-host-verifier-gui.sh
```

Artifacts are written to `artifacts/layer-host-gui-latest/`.

For the real Chromium compositor plus input gate:

```bash
cd ~/cmux-owl-render-fixture
OWL_LAYER_HOST_INPUT_CHECK=1 ./Scripts/run-layer-host-verifier-gui.sh
```

The input run writes before/after PNG pairs for the click, form, modifier,
resize-small, resize-roundtrip, scroll, and text-edit fixtures. With
`OWL_LAYER_HOST_INPUT_DIAGNOSTIC_CAPTURE=1`, it also writes post-input Mojo
surface captures and DOM-state JSON for each input fixture. Set
`OWL_LAYER_HOST_ONLY_TARGETS=scroll-fixture,text-edit-fixture` to run a smaller
visual batch; every run writes `generated-transport-report.html` plus
per-capture generated transport trace JSON.

For the focused broad gate:

```bash
cd ~/cmux-owl-render-fixture
./Scripts/run-layer-host-focused-suites-gui.sh
```

The focused runner executes four separate GUI-launched batches:

- `render`: example.com plus deterministic canvas
- `input`: click, text input, form submit, and modifier keys
- `resize`: resize-small and resize-roundtrip
- `scroll-text`: wheel scrolling and text-edit selection replacement

It also has two optional real-world or widget suites:

- `widgets`: browser-default `<select>` selection, styled fixture `<select>` selection, right-click `contextmenu` delivery, and color input click/focus coverage
- `google`: visit Google and type into the live search box

The `widgets` suite is intentionally deterministic. It verifies that widget-shaped DOM controls receive Mojo-routed input through the hosted Chromium surface, and that native popup-shaped UI is represented as typed Mojo surface-tree entries. The plain-native-select target keeps the `<select>` and its `<option>` elements unstyled, opens the native menu surface, captures it, accepts an item through Mojo, and verifies the DOM state plus cleanup pixels. The native-popup target also opens a right-click context menu, captures that menu surface, and cancels it through Mojo.

Run a smaller subset by naming suites:

```bash
./Scripts/run-layer-host-focused-suites-gui.sh resize scroll-text widgets google
```

Generate or check Swift bindings from the Mojo source:

```bash
./Scripts/generate-mojo-bindings.sh generate
./Scripts/generate-mojo-bindings.sh check
```

The check mode writes an HTML report showing the parsed Mojo declarations, the
generated Swift surface, and the source checksum.
