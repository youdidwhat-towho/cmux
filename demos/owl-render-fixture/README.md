# OWL render fixture

This verifier is the first visual gate for the OWL effort. It launches a Chromium host executable on macOS, renders deterministic HTML fixtures, writes PNG artifacts, and checks pixel colors in the captured images.

`OwlLayerHostVerifier` is the current first architecture gate. Swift loads the OWL Mojo runtime dylib, launches Content Shell through Mojo, waits for Chromium to publish a browser-process portal `CAContext` id over Mojo, hosts that id in a native `CALayerHost`, screenshots the Swift-owned host window, and checks the pixels. Swift host requests go through generated transport types from `Mojo/OwlFresh.mojom`, then through one generic Mojo runtime invocation entry point. The verifier no longer calls per-method C symbols such as navigate, resize, mouse, or key forwarding. `Scripts/run-layer-host-fixture-verifier-gui.sh` uses a Chromium-owned layer fixture context to prove the Mojo plus native display plumbing. `Scripts/run-layer-host-verifier-gui.sh` uses the real Chromium compositor portal and runs a deterministic canvas fixture plus `https://example.com/` by default. Set `OWL_LAYER_HOST_INPUT_CHECK=1` to also verify real mouse/key input changes web content from `OWL_INPUT_READY` to `OWL_INPUT_CLICKED`, type into a form field, check a checkbox, click submit, verify Command, Option, Control, and Shift modifier key delivery, scroll to a specific numbered content row with a Mojo wheel event, and exercise text editing plus selection replacement semantics. Set `OWL_LAYER_HOST_RESIZE_CHECK=1` to verify resize-small and resize-roundtrip by resizing both Chromium web contents and the Swift `CALayerHost` window.

## Current status

The real compositor path is Mojo plus Chromium-owned `CAContext` plus Swift `CALayerHost`. It does not use Unix sockets or remote debugging. The current Chromium patch adds `fresh-owl-hosted-frame-pump`, a scoped Owl switch that maps hosted surfaces into Chromium's existing renderer, root compositor, and GPU frame-pump settings without passing the broad `--disable-frame-rate-limit` command-line switch.

The current visual gates are intentionally small but behavioral: example.com, deterministic canvas, click, form typing, modifier keys, resize-small, resize-roundtrip, scroll, and text-edit selection replacement. `Scripts/run-layer-host-focused-suites-gui.sh` is the default broad gate: it splits those checks into focused render, input, resize, and scroll-text batches, writes one artifact directory per suite, and emits a screenshot checklist at `artifacts/layer-host-focused-gui-latest/focused-suites.txt`. The old full all-target run is still useful as a stress test, but it is not the default pass/fail gate because it is flaky after many sequential sessions.

## Next gates

1. Replace the patch-file workflow with an owned Chromium fork or DEPS-pinned patch application step that can be built reproducibly in CI.
2. Promote the focused-suite runner to CI on the AWS Mac so each suite reports its own summary and visual artifact bundle.
3. Expand the Mojo schema from the current verifier surface toward real OWL concepts: session, profile, web view, renderer input, and layer host/client.
4. Add popup/native widget coverage for `<select>`, context menus, color pickers, permission prompts, and other separate `RenderWidgetHostView` surfaces.
5. Add lifecycle coverage for tab attach/detach, hidden/visible transitions, crash/restart recovery, device scale changes, and cross-display moves.
6. Move from test harness Swift code toward an embeddable client library API with the same generated Mojo transport.

`OwlLayerHostSelfTest` is the smallest local rendering gate. Direct mode draws deterministic red, green, blue, and text layers into a normal Swift layer-backed `NSWindow`, proving the window capture environment. Layer-host mode creates a private `CAContext` in Swift, draws the same layers into it, hosts that context in the same Swift `CALayerHost` window path, screenshots the window, and checks the pixels. This isolates whether `CAContext` plus `CALayerHost` plus screenshot capture works before involving Chromium.

On the AWS Mac, visual LayerHost checks must run from the logged-in Aqua bootstrap, not as direct SSH children. SSH-launched windows show up in `CGWindowList`, but WindowServer can return black screenshots. Use `Scripts/run-layer-host-self-test-gui.sh` for the direct plus same-process `CAContext` gates, `Scripts/run-layer-host-fixture-verifier-gui.sh` for the Chromium-owned fixture gate, and `Scripts/run-layer-host-verifier-gui.sh` for the real Chromium compositor gate.

Run on the AWS M1 Ultra host:

For the native Swift display-path gate:

```bash
cd ~/cmux-owl-render-fixture
./Scripts/run-layer-host-self-test-gui.sh
```

Artifacts are written to `artifacts/layer-host-self-test-gui-latest/`.

For the Chromium-owned fixture gate:

```bash
cd ~/cmux-owl-render-fixture
./Scripts/run-layer-host-fixture-verifier-gui.sh
```

Artifacts are written to `artifacts/layer-host-fixture-gui-latest/`.

For the real Chromium compositor gate:

```bash
cd ~/cmux-owl-render-fixture
./Scripts/run-layer-host-verifier-gui.sh
```

Artifacts are written to `artifacts/layer-host-gui-latest/`.

For the real Chromium compositor plus input gate:

```bash
cd ~/cmux-owl-render-fixture
OWL_LAYER_HOST_INPUT_CHECK=1 ./Scripts/run-layer-host-verifier-gui.sh
```

The input run writes before/after PNG pairs for the click, form, modifier,
resize-small, resize-roundtrip, scroll, and text-edit fixtures. With
`OWL_LAYER_HOST_INPUT_DIAGNOSTIC_CAPTURE=1`, it also writes post-input Mojo
surface captures and DOM-state JSON for each input fixture. Set
`OWL_LAYER_HOST_ONLY_TARGETS=scroll-fixture,text-edit-fixture` to run a smaller
visual batch; every run writes `generated-transport-report.html` plus
per-capture generated transport trace JSON.

For the focused broad gate:

```bash
cd ~/cmux-owl-render-fixture
./Scripts/run-layer-host-focused-suites-gui.sh
```

The focused runner executes four separate GUI-launched batches:

- `render`: example.com plus deterministic canvas
- `input`: click, text input, form submit, and modifier keys
- `resize`: resize-small and resize-roundtrip
- `scroll-text`: wheel scrolling and text-edit selection replacement

Run a smaller subset by naming suites:

```bash
./Scripts/run-layer-host-focused-suites-gui.sh resize scroll-text
```

Generate or check Swift bindings from the Mojo source:

```bash
./Scripts/generate-mojo-bindings.sh generate
./Scripts/generate-mojo-bindings.sh check
```

The check mode writes an HTML report showing the parsed Mojo declarations, the
generated Swift surface, and the source checksum.
