# Chromium host notes

The verified AWS host is `cmux-aws-mac` at Chromium checkout `~/chromium/src`,
base commit `0bd9366db7`.

`chromium-patches/aws-m1-ultra-verified-owl-host.patch` captures the exact
dirty Chromium working tree that produced the verified artifacts. It is a
checkpoint patch, not an upstream-ready Chromium change. Keep it until the
Chromium work is split into a smaller proper branch.

The Swift verifier expects a Chromium build with:

- `fresh_owl/owl_fresh_bridge.*`, exposing a C ABI that launches Content Shell
  through Mojo and forwards `OwlFreshHost` events into Swift callbacks.
- `content/shell/browser/owl_fresh_host_mac.mm`, implementing the host-side
  Mojo service, input forwarding, capture diagnostics, and compositor context
  publication.
- `ui/accelerated_widget_mac/owl_fresh_context.*`, storing the latest
  browser-process portal `CAContext` id for the shell host to publish.
- `ui/accelerated_widget_mac/display_ca_layer_tree.*`, presenting Chromium's
  compositor `CAContext` inside that browser-process portal.

The portal is important. Publishing the GPU-process context id directly produced
blank Swift `CALayerHost` windows. The passing path publishes a browser-process
portal context id, hosts Chromium's compositor `CAContext` inside that portal,
then Swift hosts the portal id in `CALayerHost`.

The verified gate now includes input. `run-layer-host-verifier-gui.sh` can run
the real Chromium compositor input fixtures with `OWL_LAYER_HOST_INPUT_CHECK=1`;
the passing output shows `OWL_INPUT_READY` turning into `OWL_INPUT_CLICKED`,
then proves form input by typing `hello owl`, checking a checkbox, clicking
submit, and asserting the post-input DOM state through Mojo. It also verifies
Command, Option, Control, and Shift modifier delivery while a text input is
focused. Mouse events use Chromium's routed input path so controls activate
normally. The gate still rejects DevTools and remote debugging paths.

The AWS build used for the current screenshots was rebuilt with:

```bash
cd ~/chromium/src
third_party/ninja/ninja -C out/Release content_shell owl_fresh_bridge
```
