# Swift Unified Logging

Flag production Swift logging that bypasses Apple's unified logging system.

Report a failure when the diff introduces or materially expands:

- `print`, `debugPrint`, `dump`, or `NSLog` in app/runtime Swift code.
- Ad hoc file logging or stdout/stderr logging for production diagnostics when `Logger` or the existing cmux debug log should be used.
- A file-scoped `Logger` that is not declared as `nonisolated private let` in code affected by MainActor-by-default isolation.
- Logging of secrets, tokens, passwords, private keys, customer content, or personal data without explicit private redaction.

Allowed cases:

- CLI command output that is the intended user-facing result.
- Tests and fixtures where stdout is part of the harness.
- Debug-only `NSLog` or cmux event logging guarded by `#if DEBUG`.
- Sanitized release diagnostics in `Sources/Providers/*` that intentionally use `NSLog` for provider observability, as long as the changed log cannot expose secrets or personal data.
- One-off local debugging that is removed before merge.

Preferred shape:

```swift
import os.log

nonisolated private let logger = Logger(subsystem: Logging.subsystem, category: "FeatureName")
```

Use the right level: debug/info/notice for normal trace, warning for recoverable unexpected states, error/fault for broken behavior. Dynamic sensitive values should stay redacted or use `.private`.

When reporting, point to the changed logging statement and name the safer logging destination.
